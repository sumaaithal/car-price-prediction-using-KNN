# car-price-prediction-using-KNN
 this project is all about understanding the dataset and making predictions of price using other independent variables  by taking whole dataset at the beginning,and then by dropping  the variables that are highly correlated with the predictor variables thus visualizing the prediction in the form of line graph.
